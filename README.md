- "We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play. On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned 
with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization
that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth."

-Na engenharia de softoware, os softwares solicitam a atenção deleles durante todo o ciclo de vida do software, desde a criação até a aposentadoria do sistema, na engenharia o projeto passa por mudanças drásticas.

- "Within Google, we sometimes say, “Software engineering is programming integrated over time.” Programming is certainly a significant part of software engineering: after all, programming is how you generate 
new software in the first place. If you accept this distinction, it also becomes clear that we might need to delineate between programming tasks (development) and software engineering tasks (development, modification, maintenance). 
The addition of time adds an important new dimension to programming. Cubes aren’t squares, distance isn’t velocity. Software engineering isn’t programming."

-A programação está ligada à engenharia de software, porém a engenharia de software não é apenas programação, com o engenheiro desenvolvendo, modificando, atualizando o software quando necessário. Com a engenharia sempre se preparando
para a necessidade de modificações futuras, pensando nos riscos das escolhas durante a confecção de uma estrutura de software.
